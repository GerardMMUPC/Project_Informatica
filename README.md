Welcome to our Python Project!

We are four university students from UPC-EETAC, currently studying our first year in aerospace engineering systems. 
This is our project for our computer science subject, made entirely with python.
It mainly consists of 4 versions that, in diferent levels, aim to create, store and analyse air routes following many conditions.
These are the Youtube links to see how we have progressed:

We are constantly trying our best to learn programming skills in hopes to create a good project, that's functional and easy to use.
Keep in mind, this is our introduction to the world of computer science, since we barely have had any experience with it.

Having said this, I hope you like what you will see!
